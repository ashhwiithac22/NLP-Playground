# ðŸ§® Sentence Similarity using Jaccard and Cosine Measures

This project demonstrates how to **compare the similarity between two sentences** using two popular NLP techniques â€” **Jaccard Similarity** and **Cosine Similarity (TF-IDF)**.  
It helps quantify how semantically and lexically close two text samples are.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Description

- **Jaccard Similarity** â†’ Measures word overlap between two sentences.  
- **Cosine Similarity** â†’ Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** to compute the angle between sentence vectors in high-dimensional space.  
- Together, these methods help identify **semantic and lexical similarity** in text data.

---

## ðŸ§© Key Concepts

### ðŸ”¹ Jaccard Similarity
- Focuses on **common words** between two sentences.

### ðŸ”¹ Cosine Similarity
- Uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to represent text numerically.  
- Values range from **0 (no similarity)** to **1 (identical meaning)**.


## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install nltk scikit-learn
   ```
2. **Run the Script:**
   ```
   python ex14_sentence_similarity.py
   ```
3. **Sample Output:**
   ```
   Sentence 1: The dog chased the cat
   Sentence 2: The cat was chased by the dog

   Jaccard Similarity: 0.6666666666666666
   Cosine Similarity: 0.7995189954301454
   ```
 
## ðŸŽ¯ Insights
- Jaccard Similarity considers word overlap, ignoring grammar or order.
- Cosine Similarity captures semantic closeness using vector representations.
- Both metrics indicate that the two sentences are highly similar in meaning.
